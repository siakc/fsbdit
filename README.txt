Greetings,
This program tests memory to CPU data transfer by writing a pattern to memory and reading it back then comparing it to what should had been written. It allocates a small amount of memory and writes into and reads from it many times.

This program will only work on Microsoft Windows.

Run the program from command prompt (cmd.exe).

All versions prior to 1.5 had bugs.

Other things should be self explaining. Good Luck.
